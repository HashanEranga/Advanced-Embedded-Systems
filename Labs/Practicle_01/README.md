# CO503 : Practical 1 - System-on-Chip (SoC) Design
In this practical, you will use FPGA design tools to create your first System-on-Chip. The practical
consists of two parts. In Part 1, you will learn how to create hardware and software for a simple
SoC to control an LED counter. In Part 2 of the practical, you should build a SoC for JPEG image
compression.

## Learning Objectives:
- Designing and synthesizing System-on-Chip hardware.
- Co-design and development of embedded hardware and software.
- Hands on experience with FPGA-based design tools.

## Part 1: First SoC - LED Counter
Your task is to create a simple SoC which can display an increasing count on a set of LEDs. An
overview of your hardware system is shown in the diagrams below
